            <h1>C++, Al Pastor and a cup of Java</h1>
            <p>
              I could get lost coding for hours. I remember when I was 13, my nerd friends and I would debate over who knew more C++ (a ridiculous notion in hindsight). I claimed I knew more, but I had the vaguest clue what C++ was. All I knew at the time is it helped make all of those super cool Unreal Tournament mods a reality. So, I tried learning it. I would spend hours in my room in the basement (ha! for stereotypes) on Cplusplusforums.com trying to figure out how to make a clock that took two dates in Gregorian format, converted those to Julian dates, figured out the elapsed time and spat it back out in MM-DD-YYYY format. I succeeded. From that point on, I was hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Senior year in high school I saw an object oriented Java class. I took it and had a blast. Every 3rd period, I'd spend my 50 minutes in Mr. Bredimier's computer lab figuring out how to make robots things using Java. Time flew by in that classroom. I entered the workforce and lost sights of coding.
            <p>
							Three-ish years into a sales and retail leadership career, something was 'off'. I liked my job but I knew it wasn't a career. My employer at the time was offering nano-degree courses with Udacity for free. Naturally, I took them up on it. I was hooked. If you have ever taken an industrial psychology course, you know that self purpose within a career comes from many things. A big factor is making a tangible difference. I absolutely love putting in hours of hard work to see a working product afterwards. This combined with the thrill of continuously overcoming challenges propels me into a sense of satisfaction I believe everyone should feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free-time I love trying new hole-in-the-wall taco joints or going into different parts of the city to find the most beautiful photos for my instagram. I also trade stock as if I thought I was Cramer, and try to cook as if I was Emeril.
